SST Relocation



























# Pre-Visit Preparation

![email SST Move Request](images/sst_relocation_4.png)




Technicians will receive the retail location details, site information, and contact information, along with instructions specifying the type of relocation required. This could involve switching the site from cable to LTE or running new network cables to accommodate the SST’s new location.



Note: Refer to the SST Staging document on how to identify an LTE vs. Cable site



Example of current email SST Move Request:





If the setup involves converting from a cabled site to LTE, ensure you have the correct router for the SST site. You can request the router from warehouse associates.

If existing network cables are available, safely redirect and test the cables using a fluke tester to verify functionality.



Before the visit, review the site survey to ensure you have the necessary equipment to complete the task. Depending on the site's requirements, you may need tools such as dollies, air sleds, or a track-o.



Note: Refer to the SST Handling document for proper procedure on utilizing the equipment mentioned above.

Take a photo of the SST in retailer mode to document its current status.

Use the key to unlock the SST door and disarm the alarm by pressing the button located on the left of the CPU.

Login on the 7” screen:



Login – 4567
Password – 456789



Navigate to REPORTS > INVENTORY

Tap the printer icon on the top right of the screen and select “Full Page Print.”

Take a photo of the inventory report for documentation.



## Backup Accounting Database

![debug mode ](images/sst_relocation_12.jpeg)


Enter debug mode by inserting the USB drive into one of the debug slots on the CPU. Navigate to:

MAIN MENU > EXTENDED DIAGS > PERIPHERALS > ACCOUNTING NVRAM > BACKUP ACCOUNTING NVRAM

Once the backup is complete, power down the SST before proceeding with the move.



## Moving to the New Location

![raceway to the back ](images/sst_relocation_13.png)


If switching to an LTE router, stage the SST for LTE setup. This includes adding raceway to the back of the unit and securing network and power cables with two 45-degree cut pieces at the top.



Document the router



If it is a cabled site, cables may have to be rerun and tested depending on the distance it is being moved.



Document the # of feet of cabling used during this process.



Note: Refer to the SST Staging document for LTE and cabling setup information.



Move the SST according to safe SST handling practices to the new requested location.











## Reactivating SST

After relocating the SST and connecting the network cables, power on the SST in debug mode to restore the inventory data:

MAIN MENU > EXTENDED DIAGS > PERIPHERALS > ACCOUNTING NVRAM > RESTORE ACCOUNTING NVRAM



Once the restore is successful, turn off the SST and remove the USB.



## Final Steps

![inventory report ](images/sst_relocation_21.jpeg)


Print an inventory report and verify that the SST is functioning as expected.

A call clear slip is required upon completion of the move. Supporting photos must be captured for documentation.

Failure to submit the call clear form will result in the call being marked as incomplete.

Test the pin pad by scanning an ID card and prompting for a purchase transaction. Take a photo of the transaction for proof.













## Call Completion

Call Clear Slip

Inventory reports before and after

Elite terminal RDL router
