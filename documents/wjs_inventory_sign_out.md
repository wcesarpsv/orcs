## Procedure: Assessing Inventory Needs

### Context

### Step-by-step procedure

1. Determine how many WJS units are required to complete the scheduled service calls.
2. Confirm the correct WJS model based on site requirements.
3. Verify the model type by checking the label on each WJS box.

### Available WJS Models
- Admart Small (19")
- Admart Large (30")
- Carmanah Small (19")
- Carmanah Large (30")

### Minimum requirement
- Technicians must carry **at least two units of the required model** to mitigate onsite failures.

**Example:**  
If a *Large Carmanah WJS* installation is scheduled, the technician must sign out **a minimum of two Large Carmanah units**.

## Procedure: Requesting Additional WJS Components

### Context
This applies when extra hardware is required in addition to the WJS units.

### Step-by-step procedure

2. Record the **exact quantity** of each component.
3. Submit a sign-out request to warehouse personnel specifying:
   - WJS model (Small or Large)
   - Quantity of WJS units
